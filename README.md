# lassie-granular-locomotion
Scripts and small utilities I wrote during my USC Viterbi internship for the LASSIE project, focusing on trajectory processing, α-map generation, and understanding robot–granular terrain interactions. This work supported locomotion analysis and control-related insights for sand-based robotic movement.
